			<b>SP1: Spoopy Sprint<br>
			Group: Team Protag</b><br>
			This was our first game project at TGA, and this game was made<br>
			using Unity.<br>
			We were tasked with making an endless runner.<br>
			In this project I worked on a camera system.<br>
			It went unused however, but I learned a lot this project all the same.<br>
			I also rigged and animated a dancing skeleton that’s scattered across<br>
			the levels.

			<b>SP2: The Tale of Nether Oakfield<br>
			Group: Team Idle Rats</b><br>
			This time we were tasked with making a puzzle game for mobile devices, using<br>
			Unity yet again.<br>
			I worked on a cloud shader, I did some QA testing and I worked on performance and<br>
			stability fixes for mobile devices along with my team member Lukas Trossvik.

			<b>SP3: Mafia Man 2<br>
			Group: Datorspel</b><br>
			This was our first project in TGA’s internal engine TGE.<br>
			We were tasked with making a 2D-platformer.<br>
			In this project I made a particle system which we used for the player and for coins.

			<b>SP4: Stella’s Quest<br>
			Group: Team SP4GHETTI</b><br>
			This was our second project made in TGE.<br>
			This time I ported over the particle system from SP3 and added billboarding for the emitter’s sprites.<br>
			I also worked on a few assorted things like hunting memory leaks, bugfixing and so on.

			<b>SP5: A Brush With Death<br>
			Group: Team CatNap</b><br>
			This was the start of the second year, and this game was made using our<br>
			own engine called Kitty Engine.<br>
			We developed both Kitty Engine and this game at the same time over a short time span of 5 weeks.<br>
			The game was more of a tech demo than anything, because we had so little time and had to focus on developing a game engine.<br>
			Still, we were tasked with making a simple and short 3D-puzzle game.<br>
			I worked mostly on the sound system of the game, which meant things like<br>
			creating a wrapper around XAudio2, writing audio components and establishing their pipeline, handling playback with looping and so on.

			<b>SP6: Spite: Hymn of Hate<br>
			Group: Team CatNap</b><br>
			This was the second project developed in Kitty Engine.<br>
			Here I worked more on the sound system, and refactored it a lot,<br>
			making it easier to work with.<br>
			This time my work was more centered around polishing<br>
			the audio component pipeline.<br>
			I also worked on the animation system along with my<br>
			teammate Anton Eriksson.

			<b>SP7: Harbour Havoc<br>
			Group: Team CatNap</b><br>
			This was the third project developed in Kitty Engine.<br>
			Here I worked on the audio system yet again.<br>
			This time I integrated spatial audio and remodeled audio components<br>
			to allow for better audio concurrency, which meant being able to play back<br>
			the same audio component through new sets of voices at the same time, up to<br>
			a hard-coded limit.
