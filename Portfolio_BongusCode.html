		<p><b>BongusCode</b>, or BC:PL (not to be confused with BCPL) is a C-like compiled programming language.<br>
			It compiles straight down to assembly.<br>
			In short, it's just a little hobby project of mine which I developed to learn about compilers.<br>
			<br>
			The github-repository is available here:<br>

		<p><b>Lexer:</b><br>
			The lexer is a unicode-compatible lexer made with RE/Flex.<br>
			It is written in flex which is compiled by RE/Flex into<br>
			a DFA-based lexer implementation in C++.<br>
			RE/Flex is an amazing regex-library fit for more things<br>
			than just lexer generation, e.g. regex matching.<br>
			The main reason for using RE/Flex is for it's unicode compatibility,<br>
			since I wanted to allow for unicode symbols in BongusCode.<br>
			Another big reason is that it is very easy to use once you've<br>
			set up everything.

	<div class="fadeInTextElement">
		<p><b>Parser:</b><br>
			The parser is an LALR parser generated with GNU Bison.<br>
			Much like the lexer, the parser is written in a separate language which is compiled into C++.<br>
			In this case, the unit being compiled is a BNF grammar specification.<br>
			Bison also employs a DFA(Deterministic Finite Automaton) as a parsing algorithm.<br>
			in the generated C++ code.<br>
			The main reasons for using Bison are; it is very user-friendly,<br>
			it's available under a permissive license and it's fairly easy to set up on Windows.<br>
			Also, it works really well and is fantastic to use, much like RE/Flex.<br>

	<div class="fadeInTextElement">
		<p><b>Abstract Syntax Tree:</b><br>
			The abstract syntax tree is a collection of classes which derives from a common superclass,
			which has	the basic structure of the tree embedded in it, with things like a parent pointer,<br>
			right sibling pointer, leftmost sibling pointer etc.<br>
			One somewhat clever solution to node type reflection is using a kind enum<br>
			which is also stored in the superclass.<br>
			This kind-member is wired up while it's being created and installed in the AST<br>
			by the parser -- so upon instantiation.<br>
			This kind-enum allows us to easily get the kind of a node, which is an extremely common<br>
			operation in compilers, without having to rely on a double dispatch scheme.<br>
			This approach means that we can use a simple switch case or even an<br>
			occasional if-statement on node types, and we can also avoid the big amount<br>
			of boilerplate needed in double dispatch,<br>
			so this approach is less noisy and slightly more performant!<br>
			Each node in the tree is allocated on the heap, so the AST is not very cache-friendly.<br>
		</p>

	<div class="fadeInTextElement">
		<p><b>Application Binary Interface:</b><br>
			The ABI is a simplified version of the x64 ABI Microsoft uses in MSVC,<br>
			with a few key differences.<br>
			<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/x64-software-conventions?view=msvc-170" target="_blank"><b>https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/x64-software-conventions?view=msvc-170</b></a><br>
			One notable difference is that when passing parameters to functions,<br>
			BongusCode only allows 4 parameters.<br>
			In the x64 ABI, pointers and integer parameters 1 through 4 are passed in RCX, RDX,<br>
			R8 and R9 in that order, and parameters 5 and up are passed on the stack.<br>
			Because of how BongusCode handles stack manipulations,<br>
			it just allows the first 4 parameters,<br>
			so the stack is never used for passing parameters.<br>
			<br>
			When interfacing with libc, the stack is also aligned by subtracting 16 from rsp<br>
			right before calling the function,<br>
			then 16 is immediately added to rsp to maintain this alignment.<br>
			Because of how BongusCode handles temporaries,<br>
			the stack cannot be guaranteed to be aligned in the way the x64 ABI mandates,<br>
			so this ad-hoc alignment hackaround is necessary for all external calls.<br>
			Functions defined in BC:PL are not restricted by this however -- the stack<br>
			is never aligned when calling them.<br>
			<br>
			Temporaries are handled in a very unoptimal way.<br>
			There is no scheduling present at all.<br>
			All of the temporaries used throughout an expression are stored<br>
			on the stack.<br>
			Moreover, the temporaries are never reused.<br>
			This means that even a few moderately simple<br>
			expressions can eat a lot of stack memory (yum!).<br>
			If we examine the rule 110 implementation for instance,<br>
			we can see that it eats a total of 192 bytes(!) of stack memory,<br>
			wherein 72 of those bytes are temporaries.<br>
			In a proper compiler,	we could likely get away with<br>
			neatly tucking all of the temporaries in registers,<br>
			and not using the stack at all.

	<div class="fadeInTextElement">
		<p><b>Code Generation:</b><br>
			The code generation part of the compiler is more or less performed<br>
			right after the parser has constructed the AST.<br>
			There is no IR language in place here -- the AST serves as the intermediate representation.<br>
			This means that the compiler doesn't perform any optimizations at all.<br>
			Of course, having a low level language implementation with zero optimizations present is<br>
			not very desirable.<br>
			However, this project was made in a more illustrative and educational sense -- I wanted to have<br>
			a vertical slice of a language based on C which was as simple as could be with it still being<br>
			turing complete, so that I could learn about compiler design and have a reference resource<br>
			which I could refer to in the future.<br>
			As a side note: having a consolidated piece of code like this is extremely useful for learning<br>
			programming	in general, and not just compiler design.<br>
			Even if the web is an excellent resource (and AI now also in recent years),<br>
			it just cannot beat having everything readily available and<br>
			stitched together in one cohesive unit, and the process of<br>
			reading and watching resources on the web and actually<br>
			applying that in your projects is how<br>
			you actually learn those things.<br>
			Tying this into the previous point;<br>
			if BongusCode were to feature optimizations,<br>
			I'd have to design a complete IR language and translate the AST into this language,<br>
			and then implement several passes of optimizations on that generated IR.<br>
			So the codebase would get much larger and the extra code would obscure the vertical slice.<br>
			In short; this compiler was implemented with the goal of learning about compilers.
