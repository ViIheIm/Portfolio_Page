		<p>This piece of my portfolio is from when I was a student at<br>
			The Game Assembly in Stockholm.<br>
			Here I was a part of Team Catnap, and we made a few games<br>
			in our in-house engine which we also developed at school,<br>
			called <b>Kitty Engine</b>.<br>
			This piece was about extending Kitty Engine with new functionality.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="fadeInTextElement">
		<p>
			<b>The Mission:</b><br>
			I wanted to extend Kitty Engine with a scripting option to write game code.<br>
			Naturally, I went with Lua.<br>
			Lua is an elegant and lightweight scripting language which is easy to learn<br>
			and easy to use. Most importantly; Lua is very performant, especially<br>
			for a scripting language.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="fadeInTextElement">
		<p><b>The Plan:</b><br>
			To facilitate game development in Lua,<br>
			I needed to develop some tools.<br>
			Firstly, I wanted an in-engine text editor.<br>
			This would allow me to easily test Lua code.<br>
			Secondly, I needed to integrate Lua scripts into our component system.<br>
			Thirdly, I needed to develop a scripting API.<br>
			To enable all of this, I made use of the immaculate Lua-C++ binding Sol,<br>
			which has	made working on my portfolio piece an utter joy:<br>

		<p><b>Step 1: Hello, Kitty Engine!</b><br>
			At this point Lua was already up and running, but the environment was far from complete.<br>
			There was no error handling except for the default handler, which just throws<br>
			an error and crashes the whole program if it encounters a Lua error.<br>
			Also, there was no scripting API yet, so the most I could do at this point was mess about<br>
			with tables and print to stdout.<br>
			There was no serialization or deserialization of scripts either.<br>
			Despite the austerity of this humble environment I had set up,<br>
			Lua was still technically already integrated,<br>
			and the rest of the pieces soon fell into place.<br>

	<div class="fadeInTextElement">
		<p><b>Step 2: User defined datatypes</b><br>
			If we want to create a useful scripting API, we’ll of course need to support<br>
			custom data types. More importantly, we need to expose custom datatypes from C++.<br>
			We don’t need to expose our entire component system in one fell swoop though.<br>
			Let’s take it one step at a time, and expose a simple struct consisting of 2 ints:
		</p>
	</div>

	<a href="content/TGA_Portfolio_Piece/2_First attempt at custom data types.png" target="_blank" id="2_First attempt at custom data types - code crop">
		<img src="content/TGA_Portfolio_Piece/2_First attempt at custom data types - code crop.png" class="fadeInImageElement">
	</a>

	<div class="fadeInTextElement">
		<p>
			As we can see, we have a struct called Tuple.<br>
			We’re only interested in treating it as POD at this point, methods will come later.<br>
			Here we can also see the flexibility and ease-of-use of Sol.<br>
			Our tuple is a global instance, and after opening Lua’s libs we bind our global instance.<br>
			Then, we create a new user type for our tuple, which in this case involves just<br>
			exposing the members.<br>
			Finally, we showcase Sol’s ability to get our bound variables by getting a pointer<br>
			to our tuple (we can just directly modify the global instance of course, but I just thought it was<br>
			worth it to showcase this feature of Sol).<br>
			Using this pointer, we set the values in C++, but will this be reflected in Lua?
		</p>

		<img src="content/TGA_Portfolio_Piece/2_First attempt at custom data types - editor crop.png" class="fadeInImageElement">
	</a>

	<div class="fadeInTextElement">
		<p>
			<br>
			The answer is yes!<br>
			The instance’s members are accessible from Lua, and their values are correct.<br>
			We can of course change this instance’s values from Lua and it will be reflected in C++,<br>
			so this communication isn’t merely one-way.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="fadeInTextElement">
		<p>
			<b>Step 3: Running C++ functions in Lua</b><br>
			Exposing user defined datatypes is all well and good, but we want to expose functions too.<br>
			Luckily, Sol makes this just as easy:

			<b>Step 4: Serialization, deserialization and a pretty text editor.</b><br>
			At this point we have implemented quite a few things, and the integration is starting to take shape.<br>
			Now, I would like to serialize and deserialize Lua files from/to disk.<br>
			I would also like a proper text editor, because a default Dear ImGUI-textbox<br>
			doesn’t feature syntax highlighting, and tab switches focus to the<br>
			execute-button instead of	inserting a tab in the textbox.<br>
			My good friend and Catnap teammate Assar Bergh helped me with both.<br>
			In one fell swoop, he added an editor window and added serialization/deserialization to<br>
			the bin folder (a huge thank you for the help!).<br>
			The editor window was made using ImGUIColorTextEdit:
			<a href="https://github.com/BalazsJako/ImGuiColorTextEdit" target="_blank"><b>https://github.com/BalazsJako/ImGuiColorTextEdit</b></a><br>
			which Assar had already integrated into Kitty Engine.<br>
			<br>
			After his help, I just moved the serialization/deserialization target to a scripts folder<br>
			in Kitty Engine’s assets folder to have everything organized, and then<br>
			this step was over.

	<div class="fadeInTextElement">
		<p>
			<b>Step 5: Error handling</b><br>
			At this point we can do a few cool things with our tuple and our functions,<br>
			but developing Lua-scripts right now is still a painful process.<br>
			Granted, we now have syntax highlighting, but we still crash to desktop every time<br>
			we try to execute a Lua script with errors.<br>
			This won’t do. We’re expecting errors while we’re writing scripts, right?<br>
			We need to implement error handling that can tell us what error was encountered,<br>
			and also recover gracefully.<br>
			Luckily, Sol has not only an elegant way of integrating custom error handlers,<br>
			the documentation page gives an almost perfect implementation for our purposes, so I<br>
			copied over that implementation.

	<div class="fadeInTextElement">
		<p>
			<b>Step 6: Lua script components</b><br>
			We now have a proper editor and the means to develop and execute Lua scripts comfortably.<br>
			However, all scripts exist only in the Lua editor, which comes with a bunch of shortcomings.<br>
			Firstly, the Lua editor lives and dies with the Kitty Engine Editor, and we can only run Lua from the<br>
			Lua editor as of yet, so any release build would not be able to run Lua.<br>
			Secondly, there is no established hierarchy and no well defined architecture here.<br>
			Everything just gets ran from this monolithic editor.<br>
			The solution to this is to add script components to our component system.<br>
			This would be somewhat similar to how e.g. Unity does things, wherein C# scripts exists on<br>
			game objects, and can access their parent.<br>
			Here’s the header and the translation unit of the final implementation:
		</p>
	</div>

	<a href="content/TGA_Portfolio_Piece/6_ScriptComponent Header.png" target="_blank" id="6_ScriptComponent Header">
		<img src="content/TGA_Portfolio_Piece/6_ScriptComponent Header.png" class="fadeInImageElement">
	</a>

	<a href="content/TGA_Portfolio_Piece/6_ScriptComponent TU.png" target="_blank" id="6_ScriptComponent TU">
		<img src="content/TGA_Portfolio_Piece/6_ScriptComponent TU.png" class="fadeInImageElement">
	</a>

	<div class="fadeInTextElement">
		<p>
			As you can see, the script component is not overly complicated.<br>
			The interface provided in the header is mandated by all components, but we are mostly<br>
			interested in the methods: SetData, Awake and Update.<br>
			SetData is ran by the importer when we read in our game objects<br>
			and their respective components from Json.<br>
			All it does in this case is deserialize a script from the scripts folder among our assets.<br>
			Awake is ran once when we load a given scene,<br>
			and here we open Lua’s base library aswell as all of the functions,<br>
			usertypes and constant variables (e.g. keycodes) defined in our scripting API (more on this later).<br>
			Update is ran once per component per game object per frame, so each frame we<br>
			also update all mutating variables accessible through Lua (e.g. delta time), and then we run<br>
			the script assigned to this component, with error handling of course.<br>
			<br>
			The benefit of this architecture is that scripts can belong to game objects like any other component,<br>
			and due to the nature of our component system,<br>
			the scripts are hot-reloadable aswell.<br>
			This means that you can edit your Lua script (either externally or with the editor we built,<br>
			whichever you prefer), save it, hit stop and then start again,<br>
			and the scripts will reload completely, without having to wait for long compile times.<br>
			This allows for rapid development and testing of gameplay code.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="fadeInTextElement">
		<p>
			<b>Step 7: The scripting API</b><br>
			By far the biggest piece on this board, the scripting API defines what is accessible in Lua.<br>
			This means that all components, user-defined types, functions, methods, non-Lua variables etc.<br>
			must be registered and maintained by the API.<br>
			The header is rather simple.<br>
			It just consists of two functions wrapped in a suitable namespace,<br>
			and internal forward declarations of their parameter’s types:
		</p>
	</div>

	<a href="content/TGA_Portfolio_Piece/7_Scripting API Header.png" target="_blank" id="7_Scripting API Header">
		<img src="content/TGA_Portfolio_Piece/7_Scripting API Header.png" class="fadeInImageElement">
	</a>

	<div class="fadeInTextElement">
		<p>
			The translation unit is where it gets interesting though:
		</p>
	</div>

	<a href="content/TGA_Portfolio_Piece/7_Scripting API TU.png" target="_blank" id="7_Scripting API TU">
		<img src="content/TGA_Portfolio_Piece/7_Scripting API TU.png" class="fadeInImageElement">
	</a>

	<div class="fadeInTextElement">
		<p>
			The scripting API is by far the biggest piece of code needed in this portfolio project,<br>
			and this is an extremely modest API as of yet.<br>
			It doesn’t feature that much to be honest, but it does feature enough functionality<br>
			to develop a simple player controller with animations, as we’ll see.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="fadeInTextElement">
		<p>
			<b>All together now:</b><br>
			Enough exposition, let’s see some results!<br>
			Here is the script for a simple player controller using our scripting API:
		</p>
	</div>

	<a href="content/TGA_Portfolio_Piece/8_Player controller script.png" target="_blank" id="8_Player controller script">
		<img src="content/TGA_Portfolio_Piece/8_Player controller script.png" class="fadeInImageElement">
	</a>
	
	<div class="fadeInTextElement">
		<p>
			And here is the result:
		</p>
	</div>

	<video class="fadeInVideoElement" controls>
		<source src="content/TGA_Portfolio_Piece/9_All together now - Crop.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	</video>

	<div class="fadeInTextElement" style="margin-bottom: var(--last-element-bottom-margin)">
		<p>
			Of course, this is by no means a good player controller, it is about as<br>
			bare-bones as you can get.<br>
			Still, I hope it illustrates the versatility of the script component and scripting API.<br>
			Because of the framework we’ve established, we just need to expand the scripting API<br>
			with new functionality, and we’ve already seen how easy Sol makes that part.<br>
			<br>
			Thank you for following the abridged version of this journey with me,<br>
			it’s been an absolute blast.
